# leaflet-challenge
This JavaScript code creates an interactive map using Leaflet, displaying earthquake data fetched from a GeoJSON feed. It sets up the map with a basic OpenStreetMap tile layer and centers it on coordinates [37.09, -95.71] with a zoom level of 5. The earthquake data is styled based on magnitude and depth, with circle markers representing each earthquake's location, size determined by magnitude, and color indicating depth. Pop-up windows display additional information about each earthquake when clicked. Additionally, a legend is added to the map to help interpret the depth categories represented by different colors. Overall, the code provides a straightforward way to visualize and explore earthquake occurrences and their characteristics on an interactive map interface.
